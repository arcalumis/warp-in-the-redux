## Preamble

The purpose of this repository is to allow anyone to have the access to setting up a secure* webserver running the following stack:

- Ubuntu 20.04
  - sudo user setup
  - firewall limited traffic
- NGINX with SSH Certificate Automatically Created
- NodeJS (14.x) running Express webserver
- React JS, Babel transpilation
- Redux, Redux-Saga and Connected React Router
- Sass and Webpack out-of-the-box.
- MongoDB (optional)

Quickly prototype an idea using advanced build tools.

Note: this is a little beefy-er than the original repository, however if you want a pllugin for state management or want to learn how to put these things together, than this might be for you.

**Scratch to set up in 11 minutes**

Notes: Before beginning, you should have a domain (or subdomain) registered and ready to point to a fresh server.
*This will be necessary for setting up the ssl certificate.*

- It is not necessary to clone this repository.
 - All of the files will be automatically copied to your server.

## Let's get Started

#### 1. Setup a fresh Ubuntu20.04 Server ####
 - I use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/c3e5a07ebd4f) < My Referral Link
 - This has been tested on a $5/mo 1cpu/1gb server

#### 2. Register a Domain or Create an A Record for an Existing Domain ####
- Use the IP address of the server generated for you in the previous step

## Note: These scripts will disable root login

- ONLY USE THEM IF YOU'VE READ THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE ASSOCIATED RISKS!!!

#### 3. Login to the server as root and create a file in your home directory called setup.sh ####
- We'll go ahead and make the file executable while we're at it

``` touch setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && nano setup.sh ```

#### 4. Paste the following contents into the file, save it and exit your editor ####

```
#!/bin/bash

read -p 'Please enter a username: ' USERNAME

read -r -sp 'Please enter a password: ' PASSWORD

echo ""

read -r -sp 'Please confirm your password: ' CONFIRMPASSWORD

echo ""

if [ $PASSWORD = $CONFIRMPASSWORD ]; then
  echo 'Paste in your ssh key! '
  read -r SSHKEY
else
  echo 'Passwords Do not Match!'
  exit
fi

CRYPTPASS=$(openssl passwd -crypt "$PASSWORD")

useradd -m -p $CRYPTPASS -s /bin/bash -G sudo $USERNAME

mkdir /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh

chown "$USERNAME":"$USERNAME" /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh

chmod 700 /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh 

echo $SSHKEY >> /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh/authorized_keys

chmod 600 /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh/authorized_keys

chown "$USERNAME":"$USERNAME" /home/"$USERNAME"/.ssh/authorized_keys

echo "Your user $USERNAME is set up."

echo ""

echo "Generating Config for Step 2"

read -p 'Please enter the domain name of this server: ' DOMAIN_NAME

read -p 'Please enter an email address for cerbot certificate: ' EMAIL_ADDRESS

touch /home/"$USERNAME"/config

read -p "Would you like to install MongoDB (y/n)?" -r choice
case "$choice" in
  y|Y ) echo " MongoDb will be installed."
echo "INSTALL_MONGODB=\"yes\"" >> /home/"$USERNAME"/config;;
  n|N|* ) echo " MongoDb will not be installed."
echo "INSTALL_MONGODB=\"no\"" >> /home/"$USERNAME"/config;;
esac

echo "DOMAIN_NAME=\"$DOMAIN_NAME\"" >> /home/"$USERNAME"/config
echo "EMAIL_ADDRESS=\"$EMAIL_ADDRESS\"" >> /home/"$USERNAME"/config

echo "Init complete, please exit and log back in using the credentials you've entered."

```
- Save the file and close the editor

#### 5. Run it! ####
- You will be asked for a username, a password and a public key for ssh authentication
- You will be then prompted for a domain name and email address for your free certbot certificate registration.
  - Check out [this great website](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=generating+ssh+keys) to find out how to generate ssh keys and other cool stuff
- Tip: Have your public SSH key ready to copy and paste into the console when prompted.

```./setup.sh```

- DigitalOcean uses it's own packages so when you update and upgrade you may encounter the following:
  - If you are prompted to overwrite configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config: install the package maintainers version.
    - If you're curious about the differences, view the diff. They should be trivial comment differences but you never know.

#### 6. Part One is Finished! Exit the terminal and log in as the user you've created. ####
- Now you have a user with ssh access setup, and a config file waiting for you in your new user's home directory when you log in.
- The config file merely contains the domain name and email you entered towards the end of the previous step.
- You can use this initial setup script to quickly create a new sudo user anytime if that's all you're after.

#### 7. Now we'll create the setup file for Part Two. This script will: ####

- Enable ufw and limit connections to http, https and ssh ports
  - Defaults to 80, 443 and 22 respectively
- Generate a unique secure key ( Diffie-Hellman 2048-bit key ) for your setup.
  - This is being modified and will be changed in a future release.
- Install bmon slurm tcptrack (server monitoring tools)
- Install build-essential and tcl
- Install NGINX and register your domain with Certbot using the email address you provide
  - Redirecting all http traffic to https
  - Listening for localhost:5000
- Install NodeJS @ 14.x
  - Running the webserver on port 5000
    - This is configurable in the .env file created in your express-babel directory
      - Note: modifying this will requre also modifying /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
- Install MongoDB @ 4.4 (optional)
- Install PM2 for persisting your webserver process if and when you're ready
  - Install PM2 Logrotate to prevent an out-of-memory error
- Install BabelCli and Nodemon packages globally (cross-env is also installed but not currently used)

```touch setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && nano setup.sh```

#### 8. Paste In the Following Code: ####
- Read through the script before you install it.

```
#!/bin/bash

#pulls DOMAIN_NAME and EMAIL_ADDRESS

echo "Your domain $DOMAIN_NAME will be automatically validated."
echo "Please make sure it is pointing to the correct IP address before you continue."

#### 9. Save the file and close your editor.  Again, make the file executable and run it: ####

``` sudo ./setup.sh```
 - Note: The install process takes aboute 9 or 10 minutes depending on the options you've selected
 - You will be initially prompted for your password.

## Congrats ✨🎉

You're all finished.  
 - Your dev server is setup and ready to run
 - Your Sass will be compiled to the dist folder in main.css.
 - You got a badass Nyan Cat Favion

Start your development server with the following command:

```npm start```

Using PM2, You can persist your web server by running the following commands:

To webpack for production:

```npm run build``` 

To create your initial webserver [docs](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)

```sudo pm2 start pm2config.json```

To persist your pm2 server configuration: [docs](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/startup/)

```pm2 startup```

**DO NOT PASS SUDO TO THIS COMMAND, IT WILL PRINT THE EXACT COMMAND YOU WILL HAVE TO COPY PASTE INTO THE TERMINAL**

To disable pm2 for development purposes.

```sudo pm2 stop webserver```

Don't forget to re-run ```npm run build``` to webpack for production after making changes in development before restarting your pm2 server with ```sudo pm2 restart webserver```

Read the configs, read the docs, learn as much as you can. Happy hacking.
